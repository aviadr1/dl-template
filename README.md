```

## Setup
- edit the `name`/`description`/`version`/`author` fields in `pyproject.toml`

make sure you have poetry installed by running
  ```bash
  poetry --version
  ```
  - > if you don't, visit https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer

- next , install all tools and dependencies using poetry
  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```
  - > this will also install `pre-commit` for you

- now you can use the poetry virutal environment to run all your tools
  ```bash
  poetry shell
  ```
  
- inside the poetry shell you have jupyter lab available
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
  
### Optional: pre-commit hooks
- now run `pre-commit` to setup all your tools
  ```bash
  poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
- install your pre-commit hooks into the repository
  ```bash
  poetry run pre-commit install

## Howto
- run all hooks
  ```bash
  poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
  ```
- run tests
  ```bash 
  poetry run pytest
  ```
